## Hi there 👋


🙋‍♀️ Here we develop software for studying pornographic stereotypes. 
*Our research question is how the content and popularity of gendered, ethnic and racial stereotypes has developed over time*.

🛠️ We will use a web scraper to collect visual and textual data on millions of videos from Pornhub and XVideos (the two most-visited porn websites globally and in the Netherlands) over a 15-year period. Then Structural Topic Modeling will be used to uncover latent topics within this large complex dataset and to couple these with metadata on popularity and time of posting.

🍒 Findings from this advanced, massive scale, longitudinal study, will not only be applicable to future research on the popularity and impact of pornographic stereotypes, but on the social sciences as a whole, providing new tools for analyzing large and complex (video-based) datasets.
