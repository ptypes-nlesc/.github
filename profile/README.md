## Hi there 👋


🙋‍♀️ Here we develop software for studying pornographic stereotypes. 
*Our research question is how the content and popularity of gendered, ethnic and racial stereotypes has developed over time*.

🛠️ We will obtain textual and visual data on millions of videos from preferably Pornhub and XVideos (the two most-visited porn websites globally and in the Netherlands) over an extended period of time (more than 10 years). Then Structural Topic Modeling will be used to uncover latent topics within this large complex dataset and to couple these with metadata on popularity and time of posting.

🍌 Objective of the research is to uncover explicit and implicit stereotypes in popular porn videos. We will do this by first focusing on textual data and then on video data.

🍒 Findings from this advanced, massive scale, longitudinal study, will not only be applicable to future research on the popularity and impact of pornographic stereotypes, but on the social sciences as a whole, providing new tools for analyzing large and complex (video-based) datasets.

🥅 Motivation for this study is to show the 'social' side of human sexuality. We already know that human sexuality is bio-psycho-social phenomenon and that socialisation to a large extent shapes people's sexual thoughts, feelings and actions. Yet, much is still unknown about this particular side of sexuality. Specifically, how socialisation differently shapes people's sexual feelings and actions on the basis of their social positions and contexts. This study will allow us to significantly expand our knowledge about this and show how people's sexuallity is shaped by the social world even in the most individual of situations (as most, but not all, people watch pornography in private).
